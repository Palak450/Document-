To create a detailed report on Azure Backup for a managed instance, you'll need to follow a series of steps involving both Azure Portal and PowerShell/CLI to gather the required data. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you create such a report:

### Steps to Configure and Report on Azure Backup for Managed Instance

#### Step 1: Configure Azure Backup for Managed Instance

1. **Login to Azure Portal:**
   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Sign in with your Azure credentials.

2. **Navigate to the Managed Instance:**
   - In the left-hand menu, select `SQL Managed Instances`.
   - Select the managed instance you want to configure backups for.

3. **Set Up a Recovery Services Vault:**
   - In the left-hand menu, select `Recovery Services vaults`.
   - Click `+ Add` to create a new Recovery Services vault.
   - Provide the necessary details and create the vault.

4. **Configure Backup Policy:**
   - Within the Recovery Services vault, go to `Backup policies`.
   - Create a new backup policy or modify an existing one to fit your requirements (e.g., daily backups, retention period).

5. **Enable Backups:**
   - Go back to your managed instance.
   - Under `Manage`, select `Backups`.
   - Click `Configure` and select your Recovery Services vault and backup policy.
   - Enable backups for the managed instance.

#### Step 2: Generate Backup Reports

To generate reports, you can use Azure Monitor, Azure Backup Reports, or PowerShell/CLI. Here, I'll detail the PowerShell method to retrieve backup details.

1. **Install Azure PowerShell:**
   - Ensure you have the Azure PowerShell module installed.
   - You can install it via PowerShell by running:
     ```powershell
     Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
     ```

2. **Login to Azure Account:**
   - Open PowerShell and login to your Azure account:
     ```powershell
     Connect-AzAccount
     ```

3. **Retrieve Backup Information:**
   - Get the Recovery Services vault:
     ```powershell
     $vault = Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault -Name "YourRecoveryServicesVaultName"
     Set-AzRecoveryServicesVaultContext -Vault $vault
     ```
   - Retrieve backup item details:
     ```powershell
     $backupItem = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupItem -WorkloadType "MSSQL" -VaultId $vault.ID
     ```
   - Get backup job details:
     ```powershell
     $backupJobs = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupJob -VaultId $vault.ID -Status "Completed"
     ```

4. **Generate Report:**
   - You can export the data to a CSV file for reporting:
     ```powershell
     $backupItem | Select-Object -Property Name, ProtectionStatus, LastBackupStatus, LastBackupTime, PolicyName | Export-Csv -Path "C:\BackupReport.csv" -NoTypeInformation
     $backupJobs | Select-Object -Property Operation, Status, StartTime, EndTime | Export-Csv -Path "C:\BackupJobsReport.csv" -NoTypeInformation
     ```

#### Step 3: Compile the Report

Once you have gathered the data, compile it into a structured report. Here is an example template for the report:
